h2. Log

h3. About weeks 35 and earlier

p(plan). Getting to know the organization, methodologies and procedures

These weeks weren't officially in the traineeship period, but were used for
some preparation work and introduction at the university. Since in those two
weeks the "intensive Icelandic language course":http://hi.is/page/ilpc was
still going on, those two weeks were only half working days.

h3. Week 38

p(plan). Create detailed design, code along, starting with basic visualization

(table-row-odd). |Mon 18.09|Started detailed design on class level|
(table-row-even). |Tue 19.09|Short talk with Kristinn, <br />Discussion about whether threads are at all possible to implement, <br />RSS doesn't really support threads (as in that every semantic meaning coupled to feeds is done by humans), <br />NNTP does work with threads, but its working is largely unknown to me, <br />Will implement the system as if threads are perfectly possible in RSS and come up with a solution later.|
(table-row-odd). |Wed 20.09|Work on visualization module and AirBrush Psyclone interface, Communication succeeded|
(table-row-even). |Thu 21.09|Implemented most of the methods currently present in the detailed design.|
(table-row-odd). |Fri 22.09|Continued programming without design, <br/>Later concluded that it is not a good idea to work without proper design.|

The weekend was spent on trips to Stykkisholmur (on Snæfellsnes) and Vík
(southernmost point of Iceland).

h3. Week 39

p(plan). Create detailed design and code for crawler module. Enjoy the trip to
Vatnajökull, Jökulsárlon, Svartifoss etc.

Work on the crawler will be taken up this week, this module will hopefully be
finished completely by Sunday, in order to be able to work on the analysis
modules starting week 40.

table(log).
(table-header). |_(day). Day |_(act). Activity |
(table-row-odd). |Mon 25.09|Object model of crawler,<br />Created classes,<br />Implemented simplest methods|
(table-row-even). |Tue 26.09|Global design slightly changed, Document needs yet to be adapted,<br/>Idea to use XML dropped, using YAML now for contents of the messages|
(table-row-odd). |Wed 27.09|Design document adapted to new architecture,<br/>YAML methods for Story added etc.|
(table-row-even log-special-day). |Thu 28.09|Trip to Vatnajökull|
(table-row-odd log-special-day). |Fri 29.09|Trip to Vatnajökull|
(table-row-even). |Sat 30.09|Design document updated|
(table-row-odd). |Sun 1.10|Experimented with the Informa library,<br/>Design document updated|

Module not completed this week, will become early next week.

h3. Week 40

p(plan). Create detailed design and code for analysis modules.

The analysis modules will be fairly simple at first, just enough to provide the
visualiser with enough data to show something interesting. I planned two weeks
of work on these.

table(log).

(table-row-odd). |Wed 4.10| |
(table-row-even). |Thu 5.10| |
(table-row-odd). |Fri 6.10| |

h3. Week 41

p(plan). Continue detailed design and code for analysis modules.
