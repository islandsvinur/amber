h3. About weeks 35 and earlier

p(plan). Getting to know the organization, methodologies and procedures

These weeks weren't officially in the traineeship period, but were used for
some preparation work and introduction at the university. Since in those two
weeks the intensive Icelandic language course was still going on, those two
