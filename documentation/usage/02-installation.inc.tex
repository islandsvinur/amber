\section{Requirements}

Ambient Earth, including the applet, requires Java 1.5 or higher. Most systems
will run this version.

All libraries Amber depends on are redistributed with it. They are mostly
GPL'ed or LGPL'ed and their sources can be found on their original developer's
websites.

\section{Building the software}

To build Amber from source, there is an Ant configuration file. Simply running
ant from the top directory will compile all source files.

Building Amber has been tested and found to work in Debian GNU/Linux `unstable'
using the `sun-java5-sdk' package from the `non-free' distribution. There are a
few issues with building under Mac~OS~X. For some unknown reason Eclipse can
build it on Mac~OS~X.

\section{Using the binary distribution}

If you downloaded the binary distribution, then use the \texttt{launcher.sh}
script to launch Amber. If you are not using a Unix shell environment, inspect
the script for the workings; it doesn't do much more than setting the class
path right and then start the amber.common.Launcher class.

It is also possible to start the desired module by hand, without making use of
the Launcher class. This can be useful when integrating a module in an existing
system. Please refer to the design document for more information on starting a
module.
