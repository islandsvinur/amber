This document describes the design of the \AmbE\ project. The ambitional goal
of this project is to give an ambient view on the activity on the whole
world-wide web. In practice, it shows the activity on for instance a forum or
larger weblog system.

The name of the system is \Amber{}.

The design of the project will follow the Constructionist Design Methodology
for Interactive Intelligences\cite{CDM}. First, a few usage scenarios are given
in Chapter~\ref{cpt:scenarios}. These scenarios result in the requirements
which are listed in Chapter~\ref{cpt:requirements}. Using the requirements, an
architecture is written up in Chapter~\ref{cpt:architecture}.
