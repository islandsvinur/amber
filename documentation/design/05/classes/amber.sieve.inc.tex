  \function{The KeywordSpotter is configured to detect the presence of certain
            keywords in a story which makes it fit in a certain category or
            subject. In early versions the weights of the subjects will be
            equal. In later versions all weights of all subjects of a story
            must for instance add up to 100\%.  This gives the visualizer more
            freedom to place the story.}
