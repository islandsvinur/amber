The Particles' location is represented by polar coordinates, with ``earth''
being the origin (0, 0).

A particle can be in one of five states: new, launch, orbit, boost or crashed.
Every particle will obviously start in the ``new'' state, after which it is
launched and gets into ``launch'' state. In this state, the $r$ component will
grow until it reaches a set height above the surface of earth, while $\theta$
also accellerates to a set speed. When these values are reached, the particle
will be in orbit and thus in state ``orbit''.

In orbit, a particle slows down and slowly falls back to the earth until it
reaches some lower bound when it is considered ``crashed''. While a particle is
in orbit, it can get a speed increase, it will get in ``boost'' state. During
this period, the height and speed are increased, hereby keeping the particle
orbiting earth for a prolonged time.

While in orbit, a particle can also be attracted by certain attractors that are
located outside the orbits, dependent on the topic of the story it represents.
