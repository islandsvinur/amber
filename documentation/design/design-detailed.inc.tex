\chapter{Detailed design}

In this chapter, every single class is described in terms of interface and
functionality. Because of the fairly dynamic character of this project -- new
ideas come and go -- this chapter will not be finished until the end of the
project and will probably change regularly.

\section{Files and directories}

All source code will be in the directory \texttt{src/}. All classes are in the
package \texttt{amber} or in a subpackage thereof. The Psyclone specification
file \texttt{psySpec.xml} is found in \texttt{data/}. External libraries that
are redistributed with \Amber\ are in \texttt{lib/}. The source of this
document, the traineeship report and the website are located in
\texttt{documentation/}.

The application is built using Apache
Ant\footnote{\url{http://ant.apache.org/}} and it can be imported into
Eclipse\footnote{\url{http://www.eclipse.org/}}. It requires Java SDK version
1.5 or greater.
