\chapter{Introduction}

This document describes the design of the \AmbE\ project. The ambitional goal
of this project is to give an ambient view on the activity on the whole
world-wide web. In practice, it shows the activity on for instance a forum or
larger weblog system.

The design of the project will follow the Constructionist Design Methodology
for Interactive Intelligences\cite{CDM}. First, a few usage scenarios are given
in Chapter~\ref{cpt:scenarios}. Then in Chapter~\ref{cpt:requirements}
requirements are summed up. Using the requirements, an architecture is written
up in Chapter~\ref{cpt:architecture}.
