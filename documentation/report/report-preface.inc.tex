\chapter*{Preface \& Acknowledgements}

During the period of September to November 2006 I have been working at the
\ac{CADIA} research lab of the School of Science and Engineering of the \ac{RU}
in Iceland.

I would like to thank Kristinn Th\'orisson of \ac{RU} for giving me this
opportunity.

When I considered doing part of my studies abroad, there was no agreeement with
any Icelandic institution yet. I had thought of an internship at a Scandinavian
university and by coincidence I discovered that just weeks before an agreement
was signed between \ac{TU/e} and \ac{RU}. 

Since Iceland was high on my ``wish to visit once'' list, this was a perfect
chance. From this position I would therefore also like to thank Jan-Friso
Groote (\ac{TU/e}) and Luca Aceto (\ac{RU}) for initiating this agreement.

Others who made my stay a pleasant one were the people from the International
Offices of \ac{RU} and the University of Iceland, my fellow students both at
\ac{CADIA} and the Erasmus Intensive Language Course in August.

I have never experienced anything like this before.

Thank you very much!
