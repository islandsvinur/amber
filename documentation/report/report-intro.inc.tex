\chapter{\label{cpt:introduction}Introduction}

This document describes the activities concerning my internship at \Rvk{}
University. The introduction, which you are reading right now, describes the
structure of this document.

Chapter~\ref{cpt:assignment} describes the initial assignment as given by
Kristinn R.  Th\'orisson of \Rvk{} University. Since the final product differs
from this first idea, the changes and their reasoning are given.

In Chapter~\ref{cpt:planning} a planning is proposed. It is taken from the
planning as written in the logbook which I held online at
\url{http://nemendur.ru.is/christian06/logbook.html}.

The design of the system to be built is given in Chapter~\ref{cpt:design}.
However, since the complete design is in a separate document, this chapter is
merely an introduction and the design document is appended to this internship
report.

The complete internship is evaluated in Chapter~\ref{cpt:evaluation}. This will
contain learning points, which aspects went according to expectations and what
can be improved.

The document itself is concluded in Chapter~\ref{cpt:conclusion}.
