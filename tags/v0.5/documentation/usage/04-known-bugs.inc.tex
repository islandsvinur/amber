\chapter{\label{cpt:usage:known-bugs}Known bugs and issues}

This chapter deals with the known bugs and limitations of the current Amber
system and will hopefully be solved in the next version.

\section{Incomplete historical data}

Sometimes it can happen that a Crawler puts so many new items on the
whiteboard, that a ShowOff module which is started after that moment doesn't
receive all messages of the last two days. It is as of yet unclear whether this
is due to the communication with Psyclone or a wrongly executed command.

\section{Out of memory errors in Crawler}

After about a weekend running, the Crawler can give out of memory errors. This
could be due to the fact that new items are put into a channel, but are never
removed from it.
