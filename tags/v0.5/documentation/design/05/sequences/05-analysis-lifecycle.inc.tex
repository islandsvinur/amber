\subsection{Life cycle of an Analysis object}

An Analysis object is created by Sieve modules. They are created based on an
analysis of a Story object. After the analysis is done, the object is converted
into a \ac{YAML} string and send to the WB.Analyses whiteboard.

Here, it is sent out to all parties interested - ShowOff modules - which
convert the YAML string back into a Analysis object.
