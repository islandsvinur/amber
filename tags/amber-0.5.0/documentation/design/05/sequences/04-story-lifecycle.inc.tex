\subsection{Life cycle of a Story}

A Story object is created by a Crawler module. It will fill it with as many
information as is available, convert it into a \ac{YAML} string and send it to
the WB.Stories whiteboard.

Here, it is sent to all listeners - Sieve and ShowOff modules - which convert
the YAML string back into a Story object. The object is read and eventually
stored (e.g. in ShowOff modules).
