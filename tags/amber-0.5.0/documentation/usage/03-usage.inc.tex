\chapter{\label{cpt:usage:usage}Usage}

The system is designed to be non-interactive, so all configuration has to be
done before launch.

The available options for configuration are described in the design document
and must be set in the Psyclone specification file.

After launching Psyclone, it is advised to start the Analysis modules first in
order for them not to miss any stories, then the Crawler modules and at any
time the ShowOff modules can be started.
