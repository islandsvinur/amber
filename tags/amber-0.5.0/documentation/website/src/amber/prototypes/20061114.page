h2. Prototype 14 November

<applet archive="20061114.jar,lib/jvyaml.jar,lib/vecmath.jar" code="amber.showoff.Demonstrator" width="500" height="350">
</applet>

If you let this run for a while, you will clearly see differences in the
distribution of the trails over the topics. The demonstration uses generated
random data, so basically every topic has an equal chance to be winner for some
time and thus I cannot exactly say what is going on here. 

This one is a lot heavier to run, since it uses alpha channels to fade away the
trails of the particles. The graphics code will be replaced by something more
efficient, maybe using hardware accelleration. 

It may not be very apparent from the applet, but in full screen, the
visualization runs very slow on any machine. So while this code would suffice
for applets, it wouldn't for the fullscreen system which could use hardware
accelleration for rendering.

There is another problem with this visualization prototype: It isn't instantly
finished rendering upon load, it needs some history in order to create an
image. By this I mean that when a user first looks at the visualization just
after it loaded, it cannot draw any conclusion from it; it has to run for a few
moments to become clear.

PS. In case you were wondering, yes, these are the names of eight European
countries (and oversea territories) in Dutch.
