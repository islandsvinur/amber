\subsection{Crawler}

\subsubsection{RSS}

The RSS crawler will be fairly straightforward. There are actually quite a few
good RSS parsers around for Java, the only thing the crawler should do is
getting the stories from the RSS feeds along with meta-information and store it
on the whiteboard.

\subsection{Parser}

\subsubsection{Keywords}

\subsubsection{Phrases}


\subsection{Display}

\subsubsection{Full screen}

The full screen application will display a lot of information and is there to
be looked - not glanced - at.

\subsubsection{Ambient applet}

The ambient applet will display a very easy to understand image of the status
of the page it is on. I.e. if the page is a weblog, it should display subject
information on that weblog, if it is on the page of a thread of a forum, it
displays the flow of the discussion.
