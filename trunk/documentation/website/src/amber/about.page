Ambient Earth is a project to visualise the *buzz* of the internet. It shows
the *earth* from outer space and every time a new *story* is written, a
satellite is *launched* from earth, starting to *orbit* it.

A story always has a certain topic. It might be about how nice the flowers
bloom in spring or about higher order mathematics. Amber can be configured to
*detect* several *topics* and attract satellites towards external gravity
points representing those topics.
