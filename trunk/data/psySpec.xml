        <description>
            This module will analyze stories in the raw-stories whiteboard for
            the existence of certain keywords and puts matching stories on the
            processed-stories whiteboard, adding a category to them.

        <description>
            This module gets stories from the processed whiteboard and uses the
            story's meta-data to display the stories in a certain way that is
            ambient in its interaction.
